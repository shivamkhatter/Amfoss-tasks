i started this task late because i wanted to start this after the flutter classes in amfoss workshop and i was right they really helped me in getting this task done easily
in this the first problem i got was loading assets in which i mistakenly put the assets in the lib instead of putting them on the main folder which made me stuck 
also before adding buttons to make player move i googled how does it happens and  i found out, which made it even more easy for me to do this task but still it somehow took me 5 days because side by side of this task i was attempting some more tasks
