   ## Why must we choose you?
   
   I have that dedication and potential of coming out with flying colours in any situation given to me. I have always believed in positive approach and have followed this mantra throughout my life, even after being unfamiliar with CS in my 11th and 12th i still strived hard to take this subject as my profession as this will be a new journey for me with lots of challenges and im ready to take it. I have a high will power to complete the work in or before the given timeline. Being a student of this University and spending a month with such talented seniors in AMFOSS workshop, I have learnt that there is nothing impossible if you have the couarage to take up the challenges. I can promise you one thing that there will be no casual attitude in any task from my side any time. 
   
   ## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
 My main objective will be to hold command over 1 or 2 languages and make some projects on them. I'll make sure that in these 6 months i utilise my spare time in learning new languages and participate in various projects of the club. I am ready to take up the challenge of handling my academics, AMFOSS tasks, sports and co-curricular all together and devote myself for the positive results. 
 
 ## How would you contribute back to the club?
 I will complete all the tasks in or before the given timeline and make sure to stay positive throughout my days in AMFOSS and motivate or push others to be their best. 
 
 ## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
 I have enjoyed these days doing my tasks with full potential and hardwork. I appreciate my seniors who helped us in our group meetings and pushed us further to come out with full potential of us and gain experience. While doing my task, I gain a lot of confidence in my Computer subjects which really helped me a lot in the academics.
