this was the second task i have done after  the terminal hunt and this was going on without any problem but then adding musict to button took some time on which i got stuck but after some time of efforts and googling stuff i got the answer how to add music files to buttons 
also i recently got a problem when i changed this folder's location to amfoss tasks  and reused the site the buttons didn't showed any music from them then i figured out that its because of change in path as path in js file was different
