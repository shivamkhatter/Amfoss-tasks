this task has something fun to do with me as somebody(one of my friend) told me that its hard and you cant do it stuff so i tried it very well and worked on it day and night which in turn payed me off after 3-4 days and my task got completed 
the starting was quite easy as getting api key and making a bot on telegram with botfather was easy but when i got to printing movie response in json files i found it somewhat hard as i wasn't knowing what to do and before that printing only Specific things which this task need like movie name,etc i learnt dictonaries and strings which also helped me in printing same thing which i want 
printing movie data in csv wasn't that much hard also i used append there as in example bot there was movie adding system  not the csv restting everytime we restart it
