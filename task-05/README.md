in this task i got somewhat lucky as i didn't knew .Net so when i googled stuff i get a pseudo code of that client server application which really helped me alot in completing the task 
so i didn't got any major problem but at first my app wasn't even running as when i entered "dotnet new console -o MyApp" it was showing "segmentation fault(core dumped)" which then i googled and figured out nothing so i started over and also found that code side by side so it went easy and i didn't get any major problem apart from that thing
