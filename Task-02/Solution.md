at first 'mkdir' was used following 'touch' which made a txt file in the directory and then 'git log' was used then i checked the current branches by 'git branch -a' and after checking we had to checkout from the main branch and jump to another one and in  that i used 'git checkout (the largest continent branch name)' then i used find . -name (file name of goddess of war) after that i get back to main branch by git checkout main branch and  then i used 'cp' for copy and then i used 'cat file1 file2 file3 file4 >>password.txt' to put the passwords in password.txt and used cat for displaying its contents
