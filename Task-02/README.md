As this was my first task it was quite fun to attempt it and i really liked doing this task as it helped me a lot to understand the basics of linux terminal 
till getting the part3.txt password i was going without any problem but when i changed my git branch and listed the files i couldn't find the main branch items which panicked me as i thought it automatically got deleted but then after googling stuff i got to know that branch is changed which in turn helped me to know about changing branches 
so this task was quite easy and fun to do 
also i learnt new commands like touch,echo,cat,git checkout main,git merge branches,cp,mkdir, means every command i did was new for me because it was my first time using terminak
